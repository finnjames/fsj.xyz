<p><span class="gray">January 2021</span></p>

<p>I was selected by my university for nomination for the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, a prestigious award for undergraduates to further their science and engineering research. The scholarship is particularly focused on supporting students in beginning their graduate school careers.</p>

<h3 id="erira">ERIRA</h3>

<p><span class="gray">August 2019</span></p>

<p>I was selected for the Educational Research In Radio Astronomy program. It is an intensive course at the Green Bank Observatory involving data collection, data analysis, deadline management, and teamwork.</p>

<h3 id="hacknc-second-place-winner">HackNC Second Place Winner</h3>

<p><span class="gray">October 2019</span></p>

<p>I won second place for my hardware project at HackNC 2019. My team and I constructed a rig using Python and OpenCV to 3D track the position of objects in real time. As the team’s software developer, I wrote the system that interpreted the dual input streams coming from the stereoscopic camera setup so that the depth of the objects could be calculated in real time. In this project, I led my team to each build a part of the project separately and combine them seamlessly.</p>

<h3 id="ryla">RYLA</h3>

<p><span class="gray">April 2017</span></p>

<p>I was honored with the Rotary Youth Leadership Award for exhibiting leadership and initiative in my community service and schoolwork, and I attended the associated conference. The conference is an 18-hour-a-day high-energy event where the recipients work with each other to develop leadership and problem solving skills. I was sponsored by the East Chapel Hill Rotary Club.</p>

<h3 id="unc-department-of-physics--astronomy--research-assistant">UNC Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy <span class="roman">— Research Assistant</span></h3>

<p><span class="gray">August 2019 – Present</span></p>

<p>I do astrophysics research and software development with Dr. Dan Reichart in the Physics &amp; Astronomy Department at UNC.</p>

<p>For my first project, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/radiolevity/threepio">an open source application</a> to interpret data coming from the 40’ radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory. I engineered the data logic to interface between sixty-year-old radio astronomy equipment and modern analysis programs. I designed the UI/UX to remain accessible to the students and scientists who use it for their research.</p>

<p>Now, I am building a new front-end application for the Skynet robotic telescope network, with a focus on the radio data interpretation and analysis tools.</p>
