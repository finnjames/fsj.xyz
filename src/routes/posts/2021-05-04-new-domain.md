I am excited to report that my new domain, [fsj.xyz](https://fsj.xyz) is live. In the endless quest to have a short domain name, I elected for the gTLD **.xyz** and just my initials. It was remarkably difficult to secure a domain name that I felt excited about, but I am very happy with this one. My old domain (finnjames.dev) redirects to this site, now.

I do think it is easy to get obsessed with acquiring the perfect domain name. I went through a lot of different options before settling on this one. I can't say it was my very first choice, but as it turns out, fsj.com has been taken since the 90s. I appreciate that this one is short, easy to say and write, and is reasonably memorable.

I have also set up an email account for this domain. Try it out by sending an email to "hey" at this domain!
