# {title}

I spruced up my home page, again! This time I added a parallax effect to the illustration. As a result, I also had to update the "copy email" button effect to make more diagetic sense if it were floating as opposed to on a flat surface. Unlike the last effect, which I heavily borrowed from [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button/), this one is 100% original.

I hope the new effect makes the new home page a little more interesting than the old one. I would have liked to make the parallax scrolling a little smoother/more elastic, but I could not do that without adding a lot of CPU overhead. As a result, I removed that code and stuck with this simple JS effect.

Furthermore, in the interest of improve a11y, the parallax effect is disabled if one's OS is set to "prefers reduce motion."

**Update 27 November 2021:** I have found a better way of making the floating effect smooth without needing any animation libraries or framework plugins. Now the home page works exactly as I originally envisioned!
