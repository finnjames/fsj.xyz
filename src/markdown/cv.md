# CV

## Education

### University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

Computer Science B.S. with a Studio Art minor. GPA: 3.94. Expected graduation: May 2022.

### Honors Carolina

I joined the UNC Honors Program in my first year.

## Grants & Honors

### NC Space Grant for Undergraduate Research Fellowship

<span class="gray">June 2020 - May 2021</span>

My proposal for "A New Test of General Relativity using Binary Supermassive Black Holes and Radio Telescopes” was selected to receive funding so that I can develop and use sophisticated image processing systems for radio telescope observations of the OJ287 black hole system.

### Phi Beta Kappa

<span class="gray">April 2021</span>

I joined the Phi Beta Kappa honor society in April of 2021.

### UNC Nomination for Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship

<span class="gray">January 2021</span>

I was selected by my university for nomination for the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, a prestigious award for undergraduates to further their science and engineering research. The scholarship is particularly focused on supporting students in beginning their graduate school careers.

### ERIRA

<span class="gray">August 2019</span>

I was selected for the Educational Research In Radio Astronomy program. It is an intensive course at the Green Bank Observatory involving data collection, data analysis, deadline management, and teamwork.

### HackNC Second Place Winner

<span class="gray">October 2019</span>

I won second place for my hardware project at HackNC 2019. My team and I constructed a rig using Python and OpenCV to 3D track the position of objects in real time. As the team's software developer, I wrote the system that interpreted the dual input streams coming from the stereoscopic camera setup so that the depth of the objects could be calculated in real time. In this project, I led my team to each build a part of the project separately and combine them seamlessly.

### RYLA

<span class="gray">April 2017</span>

I was honored with the Rotary Youth Leadership Award for exhibiting leadership and initiative in my community service and schoolwork, and I attended the associated conference. The conference is an 18-hour-a-day high-energy event where the recipients work with each other to develop leadership and problem solving skills. I was sponsored by the East Chapel Hill Rotary Club.

## Work

### SAS <span class="roman">— UX Developer Intern</span>

<span class="gray">May 2021 – August 2021</span>

I am creating a new internal application to improve interface accessibility and consistency.

### UNC Department of Physics & Astronomy <span class="roman">— Research Assistant</span>

<span class="gray">August 2019 – Present</span>

I do astrophysics research and software development with Dr. Dan Reichart in the Physics & Astronomy Department at UNC.

For my first project, I wrote the logic and UI/UX for software to interpret data coming from the 40' radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory. I engineered the system to interface between sixty-year-old radio astronomy equipment and modern analysis programs, all while remaining accessible to the scientists who use it for their research.

Now, I am building a new front-end application for the Skynet robotic telescope network, with a focus on the radio data interpretation and analysis tools. This is funded by a new grant to increase accessibility of astrophysics research for students around the country.

### UNC Department of Computer Science <span class="roman">— Learning Assistant</span>

<span class="gray">Spring 2021 – Present</span>

I help teach undergraduate students in COMP541, an upper-level chip architecture course taught by Dr. Montek Singh.

### Freelance <span class="roman">— Web Developer & Designer</span>

<span class="gray">June 2019 – Present</span>

I am a freelance designer and full-stack web developer. I am a one-stop shop for local clients to create or overhaul their web presence. A portfolio example: the [Chapel Hill Friends Meeting website](https://chapelhillfriends.org).

### Carolina Friends School <span class="roman">— Counselor</span>

<span class="gray">Summer 2016 – Summer 2019</span>

I led activities with campers at Carolina Friends School Summer Programs to encourage teamwork, participation, and community.
